## Overview

The motion picture industry is a multi-billion dollar business with movie success being largely uncertain, with “hits” and “flops” released almost every year. Analytics about the box-office performance of movies can give useful information to Microsoft so that they can make the most strategic decisions regarding production and financing.


## Business Problem

Microsoft (the "Client") is interested in launching a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. In this report, we will explore what types of films are currently successful at the box office.

It's important to note upfront that while there's a lot of money to be made in the film industry, the economics of movie-making are far from simple. There's no sure path for a film to turn a profit since factors like brand awareness, P&A budgets, and the desires of a fickle public come into play. Theater attendance in the U.S. has been challenging over recent years, making it even more important to earn money in foreign theaters. Ever since Star Wars, merchandising has played a major role in revenue for films that appeal to children. Television rights, video-on-demand, and streaming services are increasingly important sources of income for movie studios.<sup>1</sup>

In this analysis, I will attempt to resolve three key questions for the Client in an effort to make a transition into movie-making successful:

* What types of movies have been produced the most in the past 20 years and what genres have been most successful?
* Which studios have been the most successful and do any warrant a potential partnership?
* Is release date a determinant of box-office success?

Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?

## Data

In this project, I will perform an analysis on several large data sets from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), The Numbers, and Box Office Mogo (BOM). My analysis is based on 5,000 movies.  The data includes many different types of information about each movie, such as genre, domestic (USA) and foreign box office earnings, studio, and production budget. Furthermore, I define success in financial terms by using both worldwide gross sales and total profit, depending on the key question being answered. This analysis only covered data about the movies themselves.

Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, including description of trends over time. 

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
