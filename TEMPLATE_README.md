## Overview

The motion picture industry is a multi-billion dollar business with movie success being largely uncertain, with “hits” and “flops” released almost every year. Analytics about the box-office performance of movies can give useful information to Microsoft so that they can make the most strategic decisions regarding production and financing. The analysis led to three key recommedations for Micosroft:
** 1. Animated films still offer the largest risk/reward equation in the movie business
** 2. Acquiring or partnering with a studio could be a viable strategy
** 3. When box office profits and generating the quickest return on investment are important, then the months of summer are the ideal time of the year to release a film


## Business Problem

Microsoft (the "Client") is interested in launching a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. In this report, we will explore what types of films are currently successful at the box office.

It's important to note upfront that while there's a lot of money to be made in the film industry, the economics of movie-making are far from simple. There's no sure path for a film to turn a profit since factors like brand awareness, P&A budgets, and the desires of a fickle public come into play. Theater attendance in the U.S. has been challenging over recent years, making it even more important to earn money in foreign theaters. Ever since Star Wars, merchandising has played a major role in revenue for films that appeal to children. Television rights, video-on-demand, and streaming services are increasingly important sources of income for movie studios.<sup>1</sup>

In this analysis, I will attempt to resolve three key questions for the Client in an effort to make a transition into movie-making successful:

* What types of movies have been produced the most in the past 20 years and what genres have been most successful?
* Which studios have been the most successful and do any warrant a potential partnership?
* Is release date a determinant of box-office success?

## Data

This project evaluates several large data sets from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), The Numbers, and Box Office Mogo (BOM). The analysis is based on 5,000 movies. The data includes many different types of information about each movie, such as genre, domestic (USA) and foreign box office earnings, studio, and production budget. Furthermore, I define success in financial terms by using both worldwide gross sales and total profit, depending on the key question being answered. This analysis only covered data about the movies themselves.
